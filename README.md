# Construction of the data flow graph

## How to start

Run file `startWind.py` - main window of gui

## Available options
1 - Choose a C file from a computer and press `Convert into LLVM` - it will generate an llvm ir module, which you can save on a computer with format `.ll` . The progress of generating is displayed in a form on the right.<br />
2 - Choose an llvm file from a computer and press `Build DFG` - it will load llvm from a file and execute the customization of every function. Then the window with customized functions is opened.

### LLVM module window:
The window contains 3 lists of functions:</br>
The first list determines the function, from which DFG will be constructed.</br>
The second list offers the option to unroll other functions in the main one if they are called.</br>
The third list offers the option to delete a specific function from the main one. All instances of calling this function in the main one will be excluded.</br>
Warning: deleting will be not executed if functions were already merged, or if a function to be deleted has more than 1 argument.</br>
Button `Generate model` runs merging and deleting chosen functions from the main one. It will trigger auto-filling of fields below describing the final function.</br>
By entering a 'distance value' and pressing `Find nodes` program will find all nodes that are at provided distance from returning node. The total number of found nodes will be written, and all nodes will be displayed in the list below.</br>
If a user chooses 1 node from this list and press `Display DFG`, it will find a path between returning node and chosen one, subsequently display it in the table on the right.

## Customisation 
excluding memory management operations</br>
identification variables based on functions</bt>
unrolling, where possible</br>
SSA for variables in every function</br>

## Libraries and environment
Python 3.7.4<br />
PyQt5 - for gui<br />
pycparser - for parsing C file<br />
llvmlite - for constructing llvm module<br />
